          <h2>Traffic Law</h2>



          <p>A Washington State traffic violation conviction can result in expensive fines, a driver’s license suspension, increased insurance premiums, and in some cases, jail time. If you received a ticket for reckless driving, negligent driving, speeding or any other driving violation, it is essential to resolve the matter in a proper and timely manner. Attorney Donna Campbell has extensive experience and knowledge of Washington’s traffic laws and court procedures. She provides aggressive, thorough and effective legal representation to clients charged with traffic offenses. She serves clients in Snoqualmie Valley, King and Pierce Counties, and elsewhere throughout the state. She offers a free consultation to discuss your case, which can be scheduled by calling her office.</p>

          <h3>Reckless and Negligent Driving</h3>
          <p>Negligent driving in the first degree results from endangering other individuals or property, and exhibiting signs of alcohol or drug usage. A conviction for this misdemeanor offense can result in a fine of up to $1,000 and 90 days in jail.</p>

          <p>Negligent driving in the second degree is similar to negligent driving in the first degree, but without the use of drugs or alcohol. This offense may result in a $250 fine.</p>

          <p>Reckless driving is more serious than negligent driving and indicates that the accused drove in a willful, wanton, dangerous manner, with disregard for the safety of others or property. A reckless driving conviction can result in a driver’s license suspension, up to 365 days in jail, and a fine of up to $5,000. Additionally, reckless driving often results in an automatic insurance premium increase. In order to ensure that your legal rights are protected, it is advisable to retain the services of an experienced North Bend reckless driving attorney.</p>

          <h3>Speeding Tickets</h3>
          <p>Even though speeding tickets are relatively common, they should be taken seriously, as a conviction can result in expensive fines and increased insurance premiums. Additionally, if a driver accumulates four moving violations in one year, or five in two years, their license may be placed on probation. Additional offenses may result in suspension or HTO – habitual traffic offender status</p>

          <h3>Driver's License Suspension</h3>
          <p>
          There are numerous offenses which may result in a driver’s license suspension. These include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Driving while a license is revoked</li>
            <li>Failure to appear in court</li>
            <li>Failure to pay tickets</li>
            <li>Habitual traffic offender (HTO)</li>
            <li>Reckless driving</li>
            <li>Excessive number of moving violations</li>
            <li>Violation of driver’s license restrictions</li>
          </li>Many others</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If your license is currently suspended or facing suspension, it is essential to resolve your case in a timely manner.</p>
